intro: Perfect for a winter comfort meal with a twist. Cripsy seared cauliflower on the outside, but soft and tender on the inside, served with creamy mashed potato and salad.
prep_time: 15 mins
time: 1 hour
serves: 4 ppl
ingredients:
    Cauliflower: '1'
    Extra Virgin Olive Oil: 2 Tbsp
    Honey: 1 Tbsp
    Garlic Cloves: '3'
    Ground Cumin: 1 Tsp
    Fresh Cracked Pepper: 1/2 Tsp
    Mustard Seeds: 1 Tsp
    Mint Leaves (no stalks): 40ish
    Juice of Lemon: 1/2
    Soy Sauce: 2 Tsp
    Russet or Yukon Gold Potatoes: 1kg
steps:
    - Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
    - Mix together the ingredients (garlic, mint, honey, crushed mustard seeds, ground cumin, soy sauce, oil, pepper, lemon juice).
    - Wash and trim the cauliflower leaves leaving the big stem intact. Cut in to 1-inch thick pieces - be careful! We want to keep the slices intact.
    - Gently rub marinade all over the the steaks and place in the oven for 45 mins
    - While the steaks are cooking, peel and chop the potatoes in to quarters, place in a saucepan of cold water and bring to the boil. Boil for 15 minutes or until soft.
    - Drain water and leave for 5 mins to let the steam evaporate (this reduces the water). Then proceed to mash with either a masher or ricer. When mashed, add the butter and mash/combine again. We want this silky smooth.
    - Remove steaks from oven after 45 mins, and get a frying pan heated on medium-high heat. When hot gently place the steaks in with 50g of butter, just to brown and finish them off (watch out for burning, they'll brown up pretty quick).
    - Place a good scoop of mash on the plate, use the back of the spoon and push it across the plate, because we're fancy. Place a Cauliflower Steak on top, with fresh cracked pepper and a couple of mint leaves on top.
