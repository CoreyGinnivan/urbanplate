prep_time: 15 mins
time: 1 hour
serves: 4 ppl
ingredients:
  - ingredient: Cauliflower
    quantity: 1
  - ingredient: Extra Virgin Olive Oil
    quantity: 2 Tbsp
  - ingredient: Honey
    quantity: 1 Tbsp
  - ingredient: Garlic Cloves
    quantity: 3
  - ingredient: Ground Cumin
    quantity: 1 Tsp
  - ingredient: Fresh Cracked Pepper
    quantity: 1/2 Tsp
  - ingredient: Mustard Seeds
    quantity: 1 Tsp
  - ingredient: Mint Leaves (no stalks)
    quantity: 40ish
  - ingredient: Juice of Half Lemon
    quantity: 
  - ingredient: Soy Sauce
    quantity: 2 Tsp
  - ingredient: Russet or Yukon Gold Potatoes
    quantity: 1kg
steps:
  - step: Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
  - step: Mix together the ingredients (garlic, mint, honey, crushed mustard seeds, ground cumin, soy sauce, oil, pepper, lemon juice).
  - step: Wash and trim the cauliflower leaves leaving the big stem intact. Cut in to 1-inch thick pieces - be careful! We want to keep the slices intact.
  - step: Gently rub marinade all over the the steaks and place in the oven for 45 mins
  - step: While the steaks are cooking, peel and chop the potatoes in to quarters, place in a saucepan of cold water and bring to the boil. Boil for 15 minutes or until soft.
  - step: Drain water and leave for 5 mins to let the steam evaporate (this reduces the water). Then proceed to mash with either a masher or ricer. When mashed, add the butter and mash/combine again. We want this silky smooth.
  - step: Remove steaks from oven after 45 mins, and get a frying pan heated on medium-high heat. When hot gently place the steaks in with 50g of butter, just to brown and finish them off (watch out for burning, they'll brown up pretty quick).
  - step: Place a good scoop of mash on the plate, use the back of the spoon and push it across the plate, because we're fancy. Place a Cauliflower Steak on top, with fresh cracked pepper and a couple of mint leaves on top.
