prep_time: 2 mins
time: 15 mins
serves: 2 ppl
ingredients:
  - ingredient: Enoki Mushrooms
    quantity: 360g
  - ingredient: Eggs
    quantity: 4
  - ingredient: Butter
    quantity: 100g
  - ingredient: Cumin Seeds (or ground)
    quantity: 1/2 Tsp
  - ingredient: Ground Smoked Paprika
    quantity: 1/2 Tsp
  - ingredient: Garlic Powder
    quantity: 1/2 Tsp
  - ingredient: Black Pepper
    quantity: 1/2 Tsp
  - ingredient: Bagels, rolls or slices of nice bread
    quantity: 2
steps:
- Put a pan on medium high heat. When hot, put Enoki mushrooms (roots cut off) in the pan and break apart (do not add oil - we're dry frying them). You might need to do this in half batches to make sure they cook off the water in them.
- When the mushrooms have lost a bit of their moisture (around 3 mins), add in the spices and cook for another 4 mins until golden brown.
- When crispy, set aside.
- Put the eggs and butter in to a saucepan and then put it on medium heat. When starting to heat up, start stirring and mixing everything together. Stir for 20 secs on heat and then 10 secs off heat. Keep doing this until almostttt cooked - they'll continue to cook through with the heat.
- Toast you bagel or roll slightly and place on the plate. Top with your creamy scrambled eggs and a good helping of enoki. Top with spring onions.
- Top with any of your favourites - sliced chillies, Sriracha sauce, crumbed feta, etc.
