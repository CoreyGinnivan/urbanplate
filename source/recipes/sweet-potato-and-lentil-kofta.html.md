steps:
    - First we're going to get the sweet potatoes going. Add some olive oil to a pan on medium-high heat and add the sweet potatoes. Stir occasionally and cook for about 15 minutes or until soft.
    - Drain and wash your lentils, then add them to a food processor along with the walnuts. Pulse until mince-like.
    - Add oil to another pan on medium-high heat and then add your lentil mixture. Cook for about 10 minutes stirring occasionally. When done, set aside in a big mixing bowl.
    - When your sweet potatoes are cooked and softened, add in to the food processor and blitz until smooth. Add this to your lentil mixture.
    - Finally the last part of the Koftas! Add your onions, garlic cloves, 1 capsicum, chili and parsley in to to food processor and pulse until small chunks, almost paste-like. Add this to your mixing bowl and combine with the lentil/sweet potatoes, set aside.
    - Get your sauce going by adding oil to a saucepan on medium heat. When hot add in your onions and saut√© for 2 mins to get some colour going. Add in your spices and sugar and stir for another minute. When fragrant add in your can of tomatoes and water, bring to the boil and then drop down to a simmer for 20 minutes occasionally stirring. Top up with more water if needed.
    - Getting back to the Koftas. First prepare a plate with some flour for rolling your Koftas in. Also get a pan on to medium-high heat, when hot add in a about 1cm of vegetable oil and heat up for frying. Get about a palm full of Kofta mixture and form in to a log or meatball shape, roll in flour and add to the hot oil. Add gently to the pan and fry for about 1 min on each side or until brown. Continue with the rest of the mixture. You may need to add more oil to get through the batch. When fried on all sides, place on to a paper towel to absorb the extra oil.
    - Get your garnish ready my combining your red onion, olive oil, tomato, capsicum, lemon juice and freshly cracked black pepper.
    - Plate up by adding some of your sauce to the bottom of the plate, place some Koftas on top and a couple of spoons of your garnish. Server with a dollop of greek yoghurt.
