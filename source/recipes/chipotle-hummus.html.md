intro: Hummus with a Mexican twist - it's really just an excuse to eat hummus as a meal. Adding Pomegranate seeds adds a refreshing burst to cut through the spice and mellow out with the coriander.
prep_time: 10 mins
time: 30 mins
serves: 3
ingredients:
    Cauliflower: '1'
    Cumin Seeds: 1 Tsp
    Coriander Seeds: 1/2 Tsp
    Black Peppercorns: '4'
    Smoked Paprika: 1 Tsp
    '---------------------': ''
    Canned Chickpeas: '1'
    Ground Cumin: 1 Tsp
    Garlic Cloves: '2'
    Chipotle Chili in Abodo Sauce (Not an entire can): '1'
    Salt: 1/2 Tsp
    Lime Juice: 1 1/2 Tbsp
    Tahini: 2 Tbsp
    Olive Oil: 2 Tbsp
    Water: 3 Tbsp
    Pomegranate: '1'
    Fresh Coriander: ''
    Corn Chips: ''
steps:
    - Start by rinsing your chickpeas and get all the gross syrupy water out of there.
    - Blend chickpeas, chipotle chili (and some abodo sauce), tahini, lemon juice, ground cumin, water, garlic cloves, olive oil, salt.
    - Hummus done! Set it aside until we need it later :)
    - For the spiced cauliflower we want to start by dry roasting our whole spices of cumin seeds, coriander seeds, black peppercorns in a frypan on medium heat for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.
    - Crush up the spices in a mortar and pestle and mix in the smoked paprika. Set aside.
    - Cut up your cauliflower in to small florets. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a frypan on medium-high heat. Wait until oil is hot and add your cauliflower in batches. Turn occasionally and cook for about 5 - 10 minutes until golden brown.
    - When your cauliflower is cooked, move to a bowl and toss to coat with the spice mixture.
    - Plate up by adding a couple of spoons of hummus in to a bowl, add a good helping of cauliflower and top with cut up coriander, slightly crushed corn chips and a couple of pomegranate seeds.
