intro: This is by no means a standard curry, but it is delicious. Similar to a butter chicken, but with cheese and spinach combining to be the hero.
prep_time: 15 mins
time: 1 hour
serves: 4
ingredients:
    Frozen Chopped Spinach: "250g"
    Haloumi: "180g"
    Onion, Diced: "1"
    Cloves Garlic, Minced: "3"
    Ginger, Grated: "1 Inch"
    Green Curry Paste: "1 Tbsp"
    Curry Powder: "1 Tsp"
    Garam Masala: "1 Tsp"
    Turmeric: "1 Tsp"
    Cayenne Pepper: "1/2 Tsp"
    Butter: "100g"
    Passata: "690g"
    Coconut Milk: "400g"
    Smooth Peanut Butter (just go with it): "2 Tbsp"
    Greek Yoghurt: "1/2 Cup"
    Coriander: ""
    Rice (for serving): ""
steps:
    - Cut your Haloumi in to 2mm slices. Heat up 50g butter in a large frypan on medium heat, and cook the Haloumi until browned on both sides. It should only take about 30 secs - 1 min on each side.
    - Using the same large frypan turn to medium-high heat, add the rest of your butter, and then your onion, garlic and ginger. Fry up until soft (about 5 mins). Add all the spices and curry paste, stir for about a minute until fragrant.
    - Add in the peanut butter and combine, then add in your Coconut Milk and Passata, then stir
    - Bring to the boil and then simmer and start reducing for about 20 minutes.
    - After it's reduced, add in the the yoghurt at this point and combine to make it extra creamy. Add in your Haloumi and Frozen Spinach, cook for another 5 mins until spinach is wilted, and you're all done!
    - Cook enough rice based on the instructions, and when fully cooked stir in a knob of butter.
    - Serve curry with rice, top with roughly chopped coriander and swirl of watered down yoghurt to look swish.
