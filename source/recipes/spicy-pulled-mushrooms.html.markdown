intro: Crispy and smokey mushrooms are the perfect fit with creamy and buttery scrambled eggs.
time: 15 mins
serves: 2 ppl
ingredients:
    Enoki Mushrooms: 360g
    Eggs: 4
    Butter: 100g
    Cumin Seeds (or ground): 1/2 Tsp
    Ground Smoked Paprika: 1/2 Tsp
    Garlic Powder: 1/2 Tsp
    Black Pepper: 1/2 Tsp
    Bagels, rolls or slices of nice bread: 2
steps:
    - Put a pan on medium high heat. When hot, put Enoki mushrooms (roots cut off) in the pan and break apart (do not add oil - we're dry frying them). You might need to do this in half batches to make sure they cook off the water in them.
    - When the mushrooms have lost a bit of their moisture (around 3 mins), add in the spices and cook for another 4 mins until golden brown.
    - When crispy, set aside.
    - Put the eggs and butter in to a saucepan and then put it on medium heat. When starting to heat up, start stirring and mixing everything together. Stir for 20 secs on heat and then 10 secs off heat. Keep doing this until almostttt cooked - they'll continue to cook through with the heat.
    - Toast you bagel or roll slightly and place on the plate. Top with your creamy scrambled eggs and a good helping of enoki. Top with spring onions.
    - Top with any of your favourites - sliced chillies, Sriracha sauce, crumbed feta, etc.
