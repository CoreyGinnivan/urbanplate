intro: Soft (but cripsy) pillowy goodness that melts in your mouth and pops with fresh herbs, with a smooth burnt butter sauce to round things up. Mushrooms provide a perfect balance and that good hit of umami that fills you up.
prep_time: 15 mins
time: 1 hour
serves: 4 ppl
ingredients:
    Large Royal Blue Potatoes: 1kg
    Plain Flour: 250g
    Semolina Flour (and a bit more for dusting): 50g
    Grated Parmesan: 40g
    Egg Yolk: '1'
    Mixed Mushrooms: 320g
    Unsalted Butter: 125g
    Fresh Thyme : 10g
    Fresh Romsemary Sprig: 20cm
    Lemon Juice: 1/2
    Fresh Bunch Chives: 1/2
    Freshly Ground White Pepper: Pinch
steps:
    - Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil. Quarter potatoes, put in to a steaming basket and place on top of the pot. Cover and allow to steam until potatoes are cooked through (about 20 mins).
    - Remote potatoes from heat and while they are still hot, place two pieces of potato in to a ricer and press directly on to a clean bench dusted with semolina. Discard the left over skin in the ricer and repeat with the remaining potatoes.
    - Sprinkle over two thirds of the flour and semolina mix over the riced potatoes, followed by the parmesa and egg yolk. Season well with salt and a good pinch of white pepper.
    - Use your hands to gently bring everything together adding the remaining flour and semolina as you go. Once all the flour has been added, briefly knead to create a soft dough.
    - Divide in to 6 pieces. Work with one piece at a time, leaving the remainder covered with a tea towel. Roll out each piece in to a log about 1.5cm in diameter, lightly dust the log with semolina and repeat.
    - Cut each log in to 3cm long pillows (try not to squash). Place the gnocchi in a single layer on a semolina dusted tray, roll to coat in the semolina and set aside until ready to cook.
    - Bring a very large pot of salted water to boil (use rock salt or cheap stuff). Gently stir the water in to a slow moving whirl pool. Using a slotted spoon, lower spoonfuls of gnocchi in to the water. Cook until gnochi begins to float, then use your slotted spoon to carefully scoop the cooked gnochhi in to a heat-proof bowl. Repeat with remaining gnocchi.
    - This is optional and frowned upon nonnas everywhere, but heat up a large pan to medium-high heat and add some butter. Add small batches of your gnocchi to the pan and make a crisp layer. Once crisped up set aside.
    - Moving on to the sauce! First lets get the herbs ready. Start by roughly chopping your fresh thyme and rosemary. Fineley slice the chives.
    - Cut up your larger mushrooms in to 1cm thick slices. Heat a large frying pan to medium-high heat. Add half the mushrooms to the pan and dry-fry until lightly coloured and wilted. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with the remaining mushrooms. Season the cooked mushrooms with a sprinkle of salt/cracked pepper.
    - Return the pan to medium heat. Add butter and cook until the milk solides just begin to brown, then add the thyme and rosemary with a good pinch of salt/pepper. Cook until the butter is very a dark brown (burnt) and the herbs are a deep green and crisp (but not burnt).
    - Moving quickly, deglaze the pan with the lemon juice and immediately cover with a lid as shit gon' get real as this will start splashing everywhere. As soon as the pan settles, quickly add the cooked gnocchi and mushrooms. Gently toss to evenly coat.
    - Serve the gnocchi with a sprinkle of chives and extra parmesan.
